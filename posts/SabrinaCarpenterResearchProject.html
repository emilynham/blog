<h1>Unveiling the Evolution: Analyzing the Lyrical Sentiment and Streaming Patterns in Sabrina Carpenter’s Career</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Earning a spot in Spotify’s top 10 artists in the world, Sabrina Carpenter has become increasingly popular this year with almost 80 million monthly listeners. However, her rise to fame in the music industry was nothing close to an overnight sensation. From releasing her first album as a star on the Disney Channel back in 2015 to releasing a now-certified gold album, <em>emails i can’t send</em>, in 2022, Carpenter has had a steady pathway to success as a pop star.</p>
<p>Having been one of my favorite artists since the start of her career, I decided to dive deeper into her journey as a musical artist. In particular, I was interested in analyzing the sentiment of her songs’ lyrics. I wanted to determine if there are any notable changes in the features of her lyrics now that she holds a well-known name in pop culture. To investigate whether the sentiment of her lyrics influenced her growing fame—or vice versa—I examined how the sentiment levels in her songs might correlate with their streaming numbers. Based on this analysis, I made a prediction about the lyrical sentiment of her upcoming sixth studio album, <em>Short n’ Sweet</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Research Question: How has the sentiment of Sabrina Carpenter’s lyrics evolved throughout her musical career, and what patterns are observable in relation to songs’ streaming numbers? Additionally, based on previous song statistics and the currently released tracks from her upcoming album, what can be anticipated about the sentiment of this new album?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>No such prior data analysis can be found on this topic analyzing Carpenter. However, <a href="https://medium.com/@roof6920/info-3501-taylor-swift-an-analysis-of-sentiment-variety-and-album-success-2858a2ef08dc">similar ideas have been explored for other artists like Taylor Swift</a>.</p>

<h1>Methods: Obtaining and Exploring Data</h1>
<p>Using the data sources below, I visualized the relationship between Carpenter’s lyrical sentiment and stream counts, aiming to determine if there is a direct correlation with her success. With this information, I made predictions about the sentiment of her upcoming album, <em>Short n’ Sweet</em>.</p>
<p><em>Note: All comments made was based on the data as of August 5, 2024. However, running the Python notebook will always obtain the most up-to-date data from the sources.</em></p>
<section id="lyrical-data-collection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lyrical-data-collection">Lyrical Data Collection</h3>
<p>The lyrical data used in this project was collected from <a href="https://lyrics.com">Lyrics.com</a>, an online music community containing a large collection of song lyrics, album information, and video clips. Lyrics.com is a collaborative platform that relies on volunteer editors to contribute lyrics and related information.</p>
<p>This website was chosen because it is one of the top lyric websites that organizes its lyrics by artist and album, which allows a more systematic method to retrieve lyric data. Additionally, scraping the lyrical data was most accessible on Lyrics.com as opposed to another lyric website, Genius, which had extra protection against robots. As a bonus, Lyrics.com also does not label song structure (such as verse, chorus, and bridge), preventing the need to take that into account when cleaning the data.</p>
<p>Focusing on Sabrina Carpenter, data was found through her <a href="https://www.lyrics.com/artist/Sabrina-Carpenter/2517092">artist page</a> on Lyrics.com. However, as some individual songs were labeled as albums on her album page, each album page URL was specified manually. Then, data from each song listed on the album page was collected systematically. Consequently, when new music gets released, or if other artists are to be analyzed, it would be simple to collect the new lyric data.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="streaming-data">Streaming Data</h3>
<p>As a way to measure the effect of her lyrical sentiment, I used the total number of streams recorded on Spotify for each song. To collect this streaming data, I used <a href="http://kworb.net">kworb.net</a>, a website containing music-related data. This website was used because Spotify does not offer a straightforward way to retrieve the total number of plays for a track. As this site collects updated relevant data in a simple format for web scraping, I used kworb.net as an alternative to directly obtaining information from Spotify.</p>
<p><a href="https://kworb.net/spotify/artist/74KM79TiuVKeVCqs8QtB0B_songs.html">Carpenter’s Spotify Top Songs page on kworb.net</a> contains a table ordering all her songs by total number of streams, with the most streamed track at the top. The table also specifies the daily number of streams for each track. Songs that Carpenter is featured in are marked with an asterisk in the title, although this is not a problem as this research focuses on Carpenter’s own songs.</p>

<h1>Results and Discussion</h1>
<p>To gain a clearer understanding of the sentiment across Carpenter’s albums, I plotted the sentiment scores for each song in a bar graph, grouped by album and arranged from the most to least positive (Figure 6). The analysis reveals that, overall, most of Carpenter’s songs exhibit a positive sentiment according to Vader’s Sentiment Intensity Analyzer (SIA). However, each album contains at least one song with a negative sentiment score.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 6. Bar Graph of Sentiment Scores Across Carpenter’s Song, By Album</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, there is a loose trend in the magnitude of sentiment across songs in Carpenter’s albums. Looking closely at the x-axis labels, it appears that in her earlier albums, Carpenter’s “positive” songs generally have stronger sentiment magnitudes. However, in her most recent albums, Singular Act II and emails I can’t send, the sentiment scores for most, if not all, songs fall within a narrower range of approximately -5 to 5. This smaller range of sentiment scores may not necessarily indicate more “neutral” songs but rather may reflect a more nuanced approach to songwriting, where strong sentiment words balance each other out.</p>

<p>Considering streaming numbers, I plotted the sentiment scores against the Spotify stream count for each song (Figure 7). The resulting plot resembles a bell curve with a mean around 5, showing that Carpenter’s most-played songs generally have sentiment scores between -1 and 10. This indicates that her most successful songs tend to have a positive sentiment, though not excessively so. However, many songs with similar sentiment scores have lower streaming counts.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 7. Interactive Plot of Sentiment Score vs.&nbsp;Streams for Carpenter’s Songs</strong></p>
<p>It is evident that Carpenter’s most streamed songs come from her recent album, <em>Short n’ Sweet</em>. Additionally, her album <em>emails i can’t send</em> features a cluster of tracks, each with at least 50 million streams, indicating that these songs have similar sentiment scores and comparable performance. This is notable because one might expect that a greater range of sentiment could appeal to a wider audience. However, it appears that a more balanced sentiment in her songs has contributed to higher streaming numbers. Furthermore, each album before this—excluding her debut—includes at least one standout track that performed significantly better than the others.</p>
<p>For a different perspective on sentiment scores and stream counts, I plotted the average values for each of Carpenter’s albums in order of release (Figure 8). This approach helps visualize the relationship across Carpenter’s musical career, despite not capturing the granularity of each individual song’s success.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 8. Average Stream Counts and Sentiment Scores Across Carpenter’s Albums</strong></p>
<p>The data reveals that the average stream count for her albums has been almost consistently increasing, with a notable surge in her latest two albums. However, the sentiment scores across albums do not follow a clear pattern.</p>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, there is not a clear pattern depicted among Carpenter’s lyrical sentiment across albums, which may suggest that Carpenter is experimenting more freely with her lyrical sentiment in different collections of work. However, it was clear that most of her best performing songs had a positive sentiment rating with low intensity, with a score ranging from -1 to 10. No song with a strongly positive or negative sentiment score received more than 100 million plays. It seems that a more balanced sentiment in her songs has led to higher streaming numbers, possibly indicating a more nuanced approach to songwriting where strong emotional elements are balanced against each other.</p>
<p>Looking ahead at her upcoming album, <em>Short n’ Sweet</em>, it is starting off with a stronger positive sentiment. However, this observation might be skewed as only two songs were released at the time of this analysis, “Espresso” and “Please Please Please”. Given her previous success with an average sentiment score of 1.10 for her last album, <em>emails i can’t send</em>, I anticipate that she will likely continue to release songs with a lower or balanced sentiment score. Nevertheless, since her current singles from <em>Short n’ Sweet</em> have achieved notable success with a positive sentiment averaging at 7.75, she may choose to maintain this direction. Still, despite <em>Singular Act I</em> being her most positive album with an average sentiment score of 8.9, it did not achieve significant success. Therefore, I expect her upcoming album to have a higher average sentiment score compared to <em>emails i can’t send</em>, but I also predict that the average sentiment might decrease slightly as she includes a broader range of sentiments to balance the album.</p>
<section id="critique-and-future-prospects" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critique-and-future-prospects">Critique and Future Prospects</h4>
<p>While sentiment scores can provide a general sense of a song’s emotional tone, analyzing sentiment word-by-word might not always accurately reflect the song’s true sentiment. For instance, the song “Don’t Want It Back” from <em>Evolution</em> has a sentiment score of -3.2. Although the Vader SIA tool might interpret this as a strong negative sentiment—possibly due to the frequent use of the word “don’t” (as reflected in the song’s title)—the actual meaning of the song is positive. In it, Carpenter expresses contentment with her relationship to the extent that she doesn’t want her heart back, indicating a joyful sentiment despite the negative score.</p>
<p>If I were to extend this project, I would conduct a comprehensive review of Carpenter’s career to understand her rise to fame more thoroughly. This may include examining various external factors beyond her lyric sentiment that may have influenced her popularity. For example, I would create a timeline of significant events in her life, explore popular trends, and analyze the efforts of her marketing team to gain a clearer picture of her growth in listeners. Additionally, I would like to study other artists across different genres and time periods to identify whether similar trends occur in their careers.</p>
